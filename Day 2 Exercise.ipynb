    "To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600\" x 240\"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. As an example, 600\" x 240\" x 1\" = 144,000 cubic inches of water for an inch of rainfall. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38)."
